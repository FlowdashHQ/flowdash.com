        <p>
          At Flowdash, our mission has always been to make the world more productive by enabling 
          everyone to build software. Since we started our journey, we’ve had the privilege of 
          helping streamline business processes and workflows for companies across a wide array 
          of industries such as fintech, healthcare, and HR.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          We’ve now taken the next step to further accelerate our mission, and are happy to share 
          that <b>the Flowdash team has been acquired by Notion.</b> As we’ve gotten to know Ivan
          and the Notion team, what became clear was how strongly aligned our operating principles 
          and values are, as well as our shared vision to make software toolmaking ubiquitous. We’re 
          excited to contribute our expertise to further realize this vision.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          As part of bringing our teams together, we’ve made the difficult decision to
          shut down the current Flowdash product on September 30th, 2022.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          We wanted to thank everyone who has been a part of the Flowdash community for
          joining us on this incredible journey. Every customer, employee, investor, and 
          prospect has played a part in shaping our product and culture and we’re forever 
          grateful to each of you for giving us this opportunity to build Flowdash together.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          We’re excited to be joining Notion and to continue building a world 
          where everyone is empowered to create their own tools.
        </p>
