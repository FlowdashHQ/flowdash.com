                <h2>Your Data Protection Rights under the California Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)</h2>

                <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law&rsquo;s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. &ndash; See more at: <a href="https://consumercal.org/about-cfc/cfc-education-foundation/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://consumercal.org/about-cfc/cfc-education-foundation/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa-3/</a>.</p>

                </ul>

                <p>Our Policy on &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; Signals:</p>

                <p>We honor Do Not Track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track browser mechanism is in place. Do Not Track is a preference you can set in your web browser to inform websites that you do not want to be tracked.</p>

                <p>You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of your web browser.</p>

                <p>Other rights you have include the rights to:</p>
